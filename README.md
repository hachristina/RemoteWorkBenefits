# RemoteWorkBenefits
# This code provides a visualization of a 2020 Dataset regarding the benefits of remote work. I created a bar chart in descending order so that the most popular benefit is displayed at the top, in a contrasting color. The title of the graph clearly states to the audience that a flexible schedule was the highest reported benefit of remote work.
